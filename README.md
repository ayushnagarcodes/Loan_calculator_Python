# Loan Calculator
I created a loan calculator using basic python and command-line fundamentals. It has two versions:- 
1. The first one "Loan_calculator_annuity.py" can be run in an IDE only. It calculates:-
    - number of monthly payments
    - annuity monthly payment amount which is fixed during the whole loan term
    - loan principal
2. The second one "Loan_calculator_command-line.py" can only be run through command-line. It can:-
    - calculate all the things that the 1st program was able to
    - Additionally, it can also calculate differentiated payment.
    - It also prompts users for invalid inputs.
